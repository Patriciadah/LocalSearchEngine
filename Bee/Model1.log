Five horses left the Imperial Palace with their masters on their backs.

The large black door went ‘Thunk!’ It closed behind us.

I turned my head to see knights standing at attention saluting us.

I slightly bowed my head and then focused forward. ‘Act naturally!’

“Like I came out to play.”

I mumbled to myself. I could feel the Imperial Crown Prince looking at me.

I thought that I grew from a regular homebody to a magnificent palace body, but going out in a new world was always exciting.

I was a bit nervous as well, as I was revealing my full body, unlike being in a carriage as usual.

I could smell the gentle aroma of winter in the clear and cold air.

“Oh, my goodness!”

“My goodness! Your loyal subject greets our esteemed Royal Highness.”

“We greet Prince Jesse Venetiaan.”

Some of the nobles who saw the door to the Imperial Palace open bowed to us on the streets.

Crown prince Cédric didn’t even pretend to look at them.

It must be rare for him to go inspect the Imperial Capital with his friends as the first people to see us reacted quite excessively.

People who noticed the halo of our male lead from a distance were quickly approaching as well.

The ladies all had flushed cheeks.

The most handsome man in this world truly seemed to be different.

“Prince Jesse!”

“Hello.”

I greeted them and the bowing ladies folded up their fur fans and rubbed their cheeks.
