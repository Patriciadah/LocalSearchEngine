I could see people gathered on the streets whispering.

It was definitely eye catching to have important figures go in to drink, only to get on the wrong side of someone even more important and get dragged out of the tavern.

I asked the two of them to wait and went to look for Bacary.

The little kid was getting onto a carriage of the Viscount’s House on his own. Sir Johann followed behind me.

“Little Bacary.”

“… “Prince Jesse.”

The night air was cold. I carefully chose my words.

“Umm, the other nobles fought for you as well. They didn’t think it was right for you to be beaten up like that so they were trying to stop the fight before it became worse. But I’m sure you already knew that.”

The seer was silent. I had nothing else to say.

It was nice to see that there were more good people than bad in the world.

However, it was also true that there was nobody who looked after him when he was injured.

Maybe they didn’t want to approach an existence who could see the future.

“I will take my leave now if you have nothing else to say, Prince Jesse.”

“Won’t you come eat some bread?”

I suddenly blurted out. Percy dug into my pocket as if he was embarrassed.

The seer looked at me with a look of disbelief on his face.

His uniquely arrogant attitude seemed to have already returned.

I could hear Sir Johann quietly chuckling behind me.

I was embarrassed about my failed conversation but I mentally placed a mask made of gold and titanium.

‘I am Ironman…’

“Juliette Palace is accepting guests again. There is no bread our Chef Laurence does not know how to bake. Please feel free to come visit if you ever feel like it.”
