“Prince Jesse!”

“Hello.”

I greeted them and the bowing ladies folded up their fur fans and rubbed their cheeks.

The way they avoided my gaze did not seem very positive.

I felt embarrassed and awkward so I just smiled.

I still did not know fan etiquette yet and wondered if that was something I should learn as well.

“Too slow.”

The crown prince let out a short grumble. I looked at him and let out a fake cough.

‘I was just thankful that such beautiful ladies were talking to me, you little punk.’

I was having a staring contest with him despite knowing I would lose when the white horse started moving faster.

‘This girl is very smart.’

“Your highness, we are heading to the tavern I was at last time first, right? To meet that Baroness?”

Christelle clearly asked from the back. I immediately nodded my head.

“Yes, Dame Sarnez. You heard the Baroness complaining there, and the Baroness is supposedly a regular at that place so I think it would be great to hear directly from a victim.”

I responded.

Christelle mentioned meeting Modeste Bacary of the Fleur-de-lis in a tavern not too long ago.

She even wrote me a letter saying that he lost his memories about the prophecy.

The thing she added on during our strategy meeting was information that was useful to this incident.

‘I was there with my mother. I heard a Baroness talking about it at the table next to us. He said that the storage rooms of the Lord’s Castle were looted so he needed to make up for it during the Harvest Festival.’

‘It might have been Madame Victoire.’

‘Yes, your highness. The person who was with him asked if it was the work of ‘that thief.’ I do not go to that tavern very often, but I see him every time I go so he must be a regular.’

That was why we were first heading toward the fancy tavern, Blois, that Christelle visited every so often.

The names of the nobles who were harmed by Victoire were already given to us in the Imperial Guard’s reports.

However, most of them did not give very sincere statements and refused to interview with the < Biweekly Riester >.

The first victim, Baroness Savanier, and Marquis Cissé, the one who had the holy artifacts stolen, were the exceptions.

I was wondering why these nobles were so passive about it, but I learned it was because of face.

They did not want others to know that a thief stole their wealth.

They did not want to mention it because of shame and humiliation.

“He should talk if he’s been drinking. His voice was quite loud at that time too.”

“Yes, Dame Sarnez. His Royal Highness is with us as well so he probably wouldn’t dare to keep his mouth shut.”

Vice Captain Élisabeth, who was in the front opening up a path, answered.

The crown prince and I were behind her with Sir Johann and Christelle in charge of the rear.

The young Countess was holding the reins with one hand as she turned to look at me.

“Your highness, you wanted to go to the commoners area after that?”

“Yes, Vice Captain Élisabeth. Henriette will only appear once I show that I am easy to approach.”

“Do you really think that Henriette is the culprit, your highness?”
