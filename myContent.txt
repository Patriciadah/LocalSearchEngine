Letter of Intent 

For Participation in the MHP Internship 

I, Braica Patricia Maria, am a third-year student at the Faculty of Automation and Computers, within the 

Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, specializing in Computer Science and Information Technology in 

English. I wish to apply for the MHP internship in Cluj-Napoca. 

I would like to bring to your attention the reasons why I believe I am a strong candidate for this project. 

Firstly, I aim to bring innovation and contribute to improving the results of MHP. I feel well-prepared to 

engage in the complex field of Java programming. My qualifications are supported by the excellent 

results I have achieved in relevant subjects throughout my three years of study. 

Secondly, I want to develop my practical skills in the technical field, particularly in software solutions 

implementation. I believe this project will provide me with the opportunity to learn from professionals 

and apply theoretical knowledge in practice. I am highly motivated by the chance to work in an 

interdisciplinary team and contribute to the development of a real-world project. 

It is essential to mention that I have already worked with this type of technology in Web Development 

during the “Software Engineering” course, where I developed a project on restaurant recommendation 

systems using Google Location and Weather APIs, implemented with Java Spring Boot. 

Additionally, I have completed the "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java and C++" course, where 

I worked on a mandatory project that strengthened my knowledge of OOP-based application 

development. 

The "SQL Programming" course provided me with fundamental skills in database management, which 

are crucial for any project involving data storage and manipulation. 

Throughout my studies, I have taken relevant courses that have equipped me with essential skills in 

computer science and applied technologies. For example, through the "Fundamental Algorithms and 

Data Structures in C" course, I learned efficient programming techniques for developing high-

performance solutions. 

During the "AI Technologies in Python" course, my teammates and I implemented complex AI solutions 

such as theorem proving and the DPLL algorithm. 

My objectives are to expand my experience in advanced technologies, particularly in web development, 

while remaining open to exploring other IT specializations. Through this project, I wish to gain insight 

into different fields where I can contribute and discover what best suits my skills and interests. My goal 

is to acquire valuable knowledge and experiment with various types of projects to eventually become an 

expert in a specific domain or position, based on the skills and passions I develop along the way. 

If you consider that my motivation and expertise make me a suitable candidate for this project, I am 

available for an interview with the selection committee. Thank you for your time and consideration. 

Sincerely, 

Braica Patricia Maria

Tabele,randuri, coloane definiție formală
Un tabel este o structură de date organizată în linii (rânduri) și coloane, utilizată pentru a stoca, aranja și prezenta informațiile într-un mod clar și accesibil.

Linie (sau rând) – reprezintă un set de date organizate pe orizontală într-un tabel. Fiecare linie conține informații despre o anumită entitate sau înregistrare.

Coloană – reprezintă un set de date organizate pe verticală într-un tabel. Fiecare coloană conține un anumit tip de informație pentru toate înregistrările (liniile) tabelului.




Microsoft Office Word
Tabele 
Citate de la experți:

“Folosirea tabelelor în Microsoft Word este ca și cum ai încerca să strunești niște pisici – tocmai când crezi că e perfect, ceva se schimbă.” 

“Tabelele din Microsoft Word sunt ca relațiile – complicate, imprevizibile și, uneori, trebuie să o iei de la capăt.”
