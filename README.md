# Local Search Engine
This project parses through and finds quickly any file in your file system!

-*Developed in third year of Computer Science for Software Design laboratory*-

Technologies used:
* React and Typescript for Frontend
* Java and Spring Boot for Backend
* MySQL as DBMS

#### Little description of the project 
The word `local` makes reference to the **local file system** rather than indicating the execution is ~~offline~~. 
Online connection is required since this is a web based application! This project strives to achieve **efficiency**, **speed** and overall **corectness**.
##### First iteration of the project - Week 4
    The first step consists of creating the ARCHITECTURE.md file that describes the base ground of the application.
    Architecture is based on C4 model developed by Simon Brown.
